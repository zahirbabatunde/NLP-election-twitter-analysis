 - Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)on the tweets data
 - Creating a Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features.
 - Training 7 classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, k-NN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest and XGBoost) on the BoW and TF-IDF features.
